  `Roman clothes were made of wool, spun into cloth by the women of the family. 
   Later on the richer people had slaves to do this work for them. If you could 
   afford to buy clothes, you could buy linen, cotton or silk, which was brought 
   to Rome from other parts of the Empire. Washing clothes was difficult because 
   the Romans did not have washing machines or soap powder. They used either a chemical 
   called sulphur or urine.`,

  `This man is wearing a toga. Only male citizens of Rome were allowed to wear togas. 
  They were made out of wool and were very large. The material was not sewn or pinned but 
  was draped around the body and over one arm. Togas were very expensive because of the large 
  amount of material needed to make them and very heavy. It was the law that all citizens wore 
  togas for public events.`,

  `There are usually about 200 words in a paragraph, but this can vary widely. Most paragraphs focus 
  on a single idea that's expressed with an introductory sentence, then followed by two or more supporting

  400 words long, but generally speaking they tend to be approximately 200 words in length`,

  `What makes these stories so creepy is the detail people put into them and how short they are. With

  for you and are fun to tell your friends to freak them out.

  `Long blocks of text are difficult for most readers to manage. But by breaking up text into sections with 
  closely related ideas, readers are alerted to a shift when they see a paragraph markerâ€”an indentation or a 
  double space between paragraphs in many non-fiction articles, especially online. And as readers, our brains 
  are trained to know that something will be different in a new paragraph`
